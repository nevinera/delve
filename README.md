# Delve

The backend implementation for a cooperative semi-realtime dungeon-delving game.
Very non-functional still.

## Setup

To start the server:

  * Install dependencies with `mix deps.get`
  * Create and migrate your database with `mix ecto.setup`
  * Start Phoenix endpoint with `mix phx.server`

Now you can visit [`localhost:4000`](http://localhost:4000) from your browser.
